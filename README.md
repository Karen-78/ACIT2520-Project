Breakdown of work:

// Mar 28 -Apr 4 (First Sprint)
// Karen Yan:

I worked on the following tasks: 
- Completed the "Edit" and "Delete" reminder tasks. 
- Incorporated the Passport Lab login screen into the Reminder App. 
    - Now only logged in users can see the reminders and only logged in users can create reminders. 
    - Logged in users can only see and edit their own reminders, not other users
- Incorporated a screen to revoke session. 
    - Users now have sessions made when they log in.
    - Right now, the logged in user can only see their own session? And can revoke it. This needs to be fixed. 
    - Tried to add store.all() but was not able to 
- Tried to incorporate the logout button and option but was unsuccessful.
 
I researched about the following things: 
- Watched and took notes on "Understanding our Term Project Start Code Part 1"
- Watched and took notes on "Understanding our Term Project Start Code Part 2"
- Watched and took notes on "Understanding our Term Project Start Code Part 3"
- Searched express-session npm, Google, Github, reddit, and many other sites on how to user store.all() to see all sessions for admin to revoke it. Was unable to find a working version. 
- Watched and took notes on Passport Lecture (Week 11)
